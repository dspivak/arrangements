# What this library establishes, and what it does not

This file is the account the code keeps of itself, and its first purpose is practical:
when the book has to decide something, this says what the library actually shows and what
it only appears to show. Every docstring that says a claim is open, inherited, or merely
illustrated points here. Read it before taking any test as evidence of anything.

The mathematics is developed in *Articulating Forms that Matter* (D. I. Spivak, in
preparation), Chapter 3; its predecessor is *Compositional dynamics in learning and
mechanics* (CDLM, in preparation), whose executable companion this replaces.

## 1. Conventions, so that nothing here is read in the wrong sign or the wrong time

**Forcing, not potential.** The driving datum of an arrangement is a one-form `omega` on
`Q x M+ x N-`, which need not be exact. When a potential exists, `omega = dU`; for a cost
`k` one takes `U = -k`, so `omega = -dk`.

**The configuration step adds.** `q' = q + sharp(omega)`. The integrator advances *along*
the forcing, whose sign already makes it descend a cost. CDLM instead calls the cost
itself `U` and subtracts; every example ported from CDLM is translated at its call site,
and the regression recordings in `tests/regress/` are stored in CDLM's sign with the
translation applied in the test.

**The integrator is part of the arrangement.** The parameter is a `cot(Q)`-coalgebra
`(Q, S, u)`, not a responsive vector space, so `Phi` takes no integrator argument. "The
same arrangement run two ways" is not expressible: heat and wave are two arrangements on
one wiring.

**Time is discrete by design.** A covector determines a displacement, one step. This is
not an Euler approximation of an underlying ODE that the library secretly means; it is
the semantics. Where a source proves a continuous-time result, the test says so and
checks the discrete analogue separately (§3.2).

## 2. What the tests are evidence of

**Strong evidence: closed forms.** Where a source states a formula, a limit, or an exact
value, the test computes it independently and compares. These are the tests to trust:
the reciprocity lemma on the three couplers, the two-tank composite, the attention
operad's substitution formulas against lens composition, and every closed form in the
attention paper's three worked examples.

**Strong evidence: two independent implementations agreeing.** The attention operad's
substitution is implemented twice — once by the paper's explicit formulas for the
composite placement, transfers, and cost, once as composition in the category — with no
shared code path. They agree to 4e-16 in the sending map, the receiving map, and every
forcing component. That is the operad-morphism proposition made executable.

**Weaker evidence: the regression recordings.** `tests/regress/*.npz` hold trajectories
produced by the CDLM companion, and the ported examples reproduce them to 1.4e-12 or
better. This proves the port is *faithful*, which is what it was for. It does not prove
either implementation is *correct*; agreement between two implementations is consistency,
not truth. Where a claim needs to be true and not merely preserved, look for a closed-form
test above, or check it by hand.

**Not evidence at all: expressibility.** Any smooth vector field `V` can be written as a
forcing by taking `omega = V^flat` with a plain sharp, making one step `x + dt V(x)`. So
"this framework can express that dynamics" is a tautology, not a result. Five examples
carry such a direct realization beside a structured one (see `reaction_network.py`), and
the difference is the point: the structured realization certifies something — a Lyapunov
function, monotone descent, dissipativity inherited under interconnection — and the
direct one certifies nothing. Admissibility as a forcing is cheap; structure is not.

## 3. Open questions the code depends on

### 3.1 The domain of `cot`

The ambient category is smooth sets, sheaves on Cartesian spaces for the differentiably
good open-cover topology. That topos does not canonically supply a fiberwise-linear
cotangent bundle on every object, so `cot` is additional structure whose domain is not
settled. **This library stays on Cartesian spaces `R^d`**, an admissible subcategory
containing every example, and records a smooth set by its dimension. Nothing here
depends on the general case, and nothing here settles it.

### 3.2 The attention paper's propositions are continuous-time

The attention operad's three dynamical results — the reader's local response, the
meeting point, and capture by a transient cue — are proved for gradient flow. The book's
dynamics is the discrete displacement map, so each needs restating with a mobility
bound, and **that restatement is not proved here**. The tests check the discrete
analogue numerically and label themselves accordingly. Six things the numerical check
settled, which any restatement has to honor:

1. **The mobility is the step.** There is no time step separate from the mobility; one
   covector, one displacement. A source's "all mobilities equal 1 over [0, 20]" becomes
   mobilities equal to `h` with the input sampled at `t_k = k h`.
2. **The bound is on the nonzero eigenvalues.** For the meeting cost the Hessian is
   positive semidefinite, and its kernel is the conserved quantity, so no mobility puts
   every eigenvalue in `(0, 2)`. The condition is that every *nonzero* eigenvalue of the
   mobility-weighted Hessian lies there, and it is an iff: straddling the critical value
   by one part in six thousand, the observed per-step growth matches `|1 - mu lambda_max|`
   to six decimals and crosses 1 exactly where the eigenvalue crosses 2.
3. **Conservation is algebraic, not first-order.** The state forces cancel identically,
   for any mobilities and any step. In float64 the drift over 500 steps is a few ulps and
   comes from the coordinate divisions, not from the dynamics.
4. **A capture hypothesis must be checked for the run actually made.** Explicit stepping
   overshoots the continuous cost; the discrete value at the end of a cue approaches the
   continuous one from above, first order in the step.
5. **Descent holds only after the cue**, during which the cost climbs. A discrete capture
   condition has to cover the driven interval, as the continuous one does.
6. **The Lipschitz constant is region-dependent, and the stiffest region may be the
   driven one**, not the sublevel set the continuous argument works over. The quartic
   preference cost has no global constant, so a restatement must name its region.

### 3.3 The integrator is `Store(S)` only

The attention paper's integrator is `(Q, C, iota)` with `C` an arbitrary polynomial
comonad, which can carry more state than the configuration. This library implements the
concrete `Store(S)` case, which is what the book's category uses. The general case is not
implemented and no example here needs it.

### 3.4 Multi-stage integrators

Leapfrog, RK4, and the K-stage machinery are present as datatypes with instances.
Whether the assignment from arrangements to K-stage coalgebras is a *functor*, and
whether it is monoidal, is left open, exactly as in CDLM. Their docstrings say so.

### 3.5 The commons model, and four things it corrected

`commons.py` and `commons_entry.py` implement a shared-resource model — one resource, `N`
extractors, and three wirings over one fixed cost — as genuine composites, so the fan-out's
transpose delivering the total to the resource is read off rather than written by hand.
Running it corrected four claims that had been made *on paper* and were wrong. They are
recorded because each was plausible and each was believed:

1. **An external enforcer applying a fixed rule is exact, not unilateral.** A coupler
   returning the same sanction to every participant while itself unmoved by them has a
   symmetric returned-covector Jacobian, so `d omega = 0`. What is genuinely non-exact is an
   enforcer whose **own state** sets the sanction while nothing comes back to it. The
   distinction is discretion, not externality.
2. **The mean readout is proximity-blind.** For a message `(kappa R, kappa)` the mean is `R`
   for every `kappa`. Proximity changes the weight, never the mean, so a quantity that
   should depend on being close cannot ride on the mean readout. Being near changes what you
   can take, not what you believe.
3. **A lifetime scaling derived at a settled state need not survive the driven regime.**
   The predicted `1/N` scaling of a supply's lifetime held only when the stock moves slowly
   against effort; at the reference starting point the stock is fast, effort is frozen, and
   the measured ratio was 17 where 2 was predicted.
4. **A convergence bound with a complex spectrum is not `2/|lambda_max|`** but
   `min_j(-2 Re lambda_j)/|lambda_j|^2`. Under the un-sanctioned wiring `N` never enters the
   effort rate at all, because the extractors are mutually invisible to one another.

**What the model does not establish**, beyond the general caveats above. The sign of a
placement coordinate's response is not fixed by the formalism — it says which boxes exist
and how they couple, not which box owns a placement — and it was chosen by hand; the other
choice reverses every entry result. Zero coupling is a fixed point with vanishing gradient,
so a participant placed far away never arrives: entry must be seeded inside a pull region
whose size nothing here fixes. The settling point is a set, not a number, selected by
initial placements. And the economics is imported wholesale.

### 3.6 Functoriality is tested, not proved

That composition agrees with dynamics is checked on instances — chains, graphs, nests,
and a non-exact coupler — not proved here. The proof belongs to the book. A passing test
suite is a warning system, not a certificate.

### 3.7 Two proposed costs on the reader, and four things they corrected

Neither construction here is in the attention paper. Both put the mean readout inside a
cost, which leaves the paper's affine-quadratic family, so the Hessian is not constant and
each run states where its mobility came from. Every docstring says which of three things
its test does: reproduce a closed form derived in the docstring, check a discrete analogue
(§3.2), or correct a claim made on paper.

**The member test** (`tests/test_member.py`; construction and numbers in
`notes/MEMBER-TEST.md`) runs the book plan's proposed definition of *member*. A part's
residual is its cost minimized over its own configuration, `r(e) = min_q k(q, e)`; it *wants*
something of its input iff `r` varies with what it receives, and it is a member at a state iff
`r(received) < r(0)`. (The book plan called that variation a *need*; since 2026-09-25 it calls
it a **want** and defines *need* separately, as what a part must receive for its own parts to
keep returning, which §3.8 below tests. The two are not genus and species: a want is read off
the part's own cost and exists only where its forcing is exact, a need needs no potential, and
§3.8's parts have needs and no wants.) What the three runs support: the residual separates a want from a
bond-like cost — a self-sufficient part receiving exactly what the needy part receives is
never a member, and the needy part becomes one once the source's signal has descended — and
a reader between a source at `0` and one at `nu` moves away from the first and toward the
second at every step. Two claims made on paper did not survive:

1. **A quadratic outer cost does not outweigh a member of a member out of membership at
   any finite weight.** With outer weight `lam` the inner residual is
   `(1/2) nu^2 (lam/(1+lam))^2`, strictly below `r(0)` for every finite `lam`; only the
   margin `r(0) - r(received)` erodes, to `0.0099` at `lam = 100`. Under the strict
   inequality loss of membership is a limit, so a definition that wants "outweighed" to end
   membership needs a threshold or a comparison of margins.
2. **Under the mean readout the need is a ray, not a point.** `argmin_e r(e)` is
   `{(nu w, w, p) : w > 0}`, and in the leaving run no configuration realizes it, so the
   reader passes the second source and keeps going, the force decaying without a settled
   state. The paper's Example 1 settles because its cost is on the weighted input.

**The curious reader** (`tests/test_curious_reader.py`) adds an information-gain term,
Lindley's expected gain of a Gaussian channel, to the reader's cost on the three-child
spatial arrangement of `tests/test_reader.py`, between a weak confirming source and a strong
disconfirming one. Eight tests in three stages. The crossover `lam*` of the midpoint force at
a held prediction is reproduced to `1e-15` relative. Two claims made on paper did not
survive, and one prediction written before its run held:

3. **A free prediction never confirms.** With nothing holding it, the prediction adjusts to
   what is heard and only precision remains, so the reader ends at the precise source for
   every `lam > 0`. Confirmation needs the prediction held by a prior term, and the dial is
   then the prior precision `w_pi`: the crossover becomes `w_pi/(1 + w_pi)` times the
   held-prediction value, `lam*/2` at `w_pi = 1`, reproduced by bisection to `1e-12`.
4. **The predicted mobility window up to `lam*` does not exist.** With the prior term the
   confirming basin closes at `lam_A = 0.807`, below `lam* = 1.19`, so the settled regime is
   set by the reduced cost's basins and `lam*` governs the transient only. Inside
   `(lam*/2, lam_A)` the prediction written first held: the ratio of the prediction's
   mobility to the position's selects the basin, a slow reviser settling in the confirming
   local minimum and a fast one in the precise global one. Equal mobilities went to the
   precise source in the two cases run; the boundary was not located.

What neither establishes: whether *member* or the information term belongs in the book is
not a question the code answers, and the definitions run here are the plan's proposals, not
the book's. The reruns the member test calls for — the want restated on the weighted input,
and a non-quadratic outer cost — are listed in the book plan and have not been run.

### 3.8 Mutual need, and what carries it

`tests/test_mutual_need.py` (8 tests; construction, closed forms and numbers in
`notes/MUTUAL-NEED-TEST.md`) builds two parts, each a driven steady state in §3.1's sense —
its configuration the amplitude of its own form, held nonzero while flux passes — each of
whose held form is supplied by the other, with one supply entering the pair from outside as a
zero-response box. Four predictions were fixed before the run: both forms held while the
supply runs; cutting the supply ends both; cutting either internal link ends both; neither
part holds its form alone. A supply wired straight to one part fails the last two. A supply
**gated** by the parts' activity, `intake = s q_A q_B/(K + q_A q_B)`, holds all four.

1. **The gated forcing is genuinely non-exact.** `(d omega)_AB = alpha(gamma - beta) - alpha s
   q_A K/(K + u)^2` with `u = q_A q_B`, reproduced to `1e-10`, equal to `-0.1141566` at the
   settled state. It does not involve the covector returned at the supply's port, whose
   response is zero, so no bookkeeping there removes it, and it varies with the state, so no
   constant `beta - gamma` does. The construction therefore sits inside the book's category,
   whose forcing need not be exact (§1), and outside the attention operad, whose forcing is
   the full differential of a nonnegative cost.
2. **One-way supply is not what costs exactness; a non-reciprocal response is.** The *linear*
   loop is exact to `1e-12`, with potential `alpha(q_A s + beta q_A q_B)`, even though its
   supply is one-way — because the supply's response is zero. This is §3.5 item 1 one case
   over, and the second time the same belief has been corrected here, so the rule is the thing
   to carry: unilaterality in the wiring does not make a forcing non-exact.
3. **Which verdicts the parameters decide.** Prediction 1 needs the supply above a threshold
   `s_*` set by the gate's half-saturation, and prediction 2 needs the internal loop gain below
   the dissipation, `alpha^2 beta gamma < b^2` — at `beta gamma = 1` the unsupplied pair holds
   its form for nothing, and above it the pair diverges. The formalism does not enforce that
   inequality. Near its boundary the run *length* decides what a run sees: at `0.9801`, two
   hundred time units report the form held at `0.500` while it is still decaying, so a
   persistence claim needs a rate, not a final reading.
4. **What the wiring decides, and it is not a parameter.** Predictions 3 and 4 hold for every
   parameter setting swept (eighteen cases, `beta gamma` from `0.04` to `1.1025`, `s` in
   `{2.2, 4, 40}`, both cuts killing both parts in all of them), provided the wiring has no
   ungated path from the supply to either part: cutting the partner's wire makes the gate read
   zero, so the part has no drive at all. Any ungated leak, however small, breaks them
   strictly. And **autocatalysis is not mutuality**: a gate reading a part's *own* activity
   leaves that part held alone at `2 + sqrt 3`. What the predictions need is that every path
   from the supply to each part pass through the other part's signal.
5. **A restart threshold, structural.** The forcing vanishes identically at the origin and the
   origin is stable, eigenvalues `-b ± alpha sqrt(beta gamma)`, so a pair started too low never
   gets going — the fixed point with vanishing gradient that §3.5 also found. The threshold is
   the lower root's stable manifold, a curve and not a number: on the ray through the saddle it
   is the saddle at every mobility, and off it moves with the step to first order.

**What this does not establish.** That arrangements tend to fall in the region where the four
predictions hold; §2's warning applies in full, since exhibiting one loop that behaves as
wanted proves nothing about the class of loops that do. What the runs deliver is the boundary
of that region. The gate's Michaelis–Menten shape is a **model** of metabolism, not a
derivation. The supply is a zero-response box, so nothing depletes and the finite-reservoir
lifetime bound is a separate matter. And the decay of an unsupplied amplitude is this
library's deterministic descent, not an entropic force: nothing here is random, and the
scattering of an unkept form is supplied by an environment the model does not draw.

## 4. Where the mathematics is written down

- The category of arrangements, the forcing, the coalgebra, and the dynamics functor:
  *Articulating Forms that Matter*, Chapter 3.
- Retroactivity, the reciprocity lemma, Kirchhoff's current law as the transpose of
  copying, and the three couplers: the same, Chapter 2, following
  Del Vecchio–Ninfa–Sontag and Sontag's lectures on retroactivity.
- The attention operad, its substitution, and its three worked examples: a companion
  paper on affine quadratic arrangements, in preparation.
- Everything ported from CDLM cites CDLM's own labels (`ex.`, `prop.`, `sec.`) in its
  docstring, so a reader with that draft can find the statement being implemented.
